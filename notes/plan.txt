Picross Plan:

1. Initial shadowing pass along each axis
    a) For each run, we know the known span as well as the bounds
    b) For each tile we know all the possible A runs and gaps that it could belong to
    c) If a tile belongs to only one possible run or gap, fill or cross the tile
        - On initial pass, crosses are only known if the line is complete

2. Additional passes
    a) Clip run bounds if it is divided by crosses and the run can't fit in a segment
        - need subdivision system
    b) Clip run bounds while the edge is adjacent to an external fill
    c) Clip run bounds where placement of the run would result in an edge adjacent to an internal fill
        - can also subdivide on this
DONEd) Expand known run to adjacent internal fills
